# Genetic Algorithm
## Introduction
This repository implements genetic algorithms to solve two classical optimization problems: the Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) and the Knapsack Problem.

## Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP)
Problem Description
The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a well-known combinatorial optimization problem. The objective is to find the shortest possible route that visits each city exactly once and returns to the origin city. Given a list of cities and the distances between each pair of cities, the task is to determine the optimal order in which to visit the cities to minimize the total travel distance.

## Knapsack Problem
Problem Description
The Knapsack Problem is another classic optimization problem. Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, the objective is to determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is less than or equal to a given limit and the total value is as large as possible.
